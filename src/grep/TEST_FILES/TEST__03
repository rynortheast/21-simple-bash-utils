so
Calmly feel myself evolving
Appalling, so much I'm not divulging
Been stalling, I think I hear applauding, they're calling
Mixtapes aren't my thing but it's been awfully
Exhausting, hanging onto songs this long is daunting (Yeah)
Which caused me to have make a call I thought was ballsy


Resulting in what you see today, proceed indulging
    As always, the one trick pony's here, so quit your sulking
Born efficient, got ambition, sorta vicious, yup, that's me

Not artistic, unrealistic, chauvinistic, not those things

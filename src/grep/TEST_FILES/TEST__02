
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?



Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rapâ€”yeah, I know it'so hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me (Ahh)
I know this prolly isn't really realistic

And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it

I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me

Educational project SimpleBashUtils from organization ¬´School 21¬ª.

Development of Bash text utilities cat & grep in C programming languages. Developed functions have all the original flags supported, including paired combinations.

USEFUL NOTES:

- there is a significant difference in work of commands on other operating systems. It was not possible to find best testing option, except for using machines on campus.
- cat command has the ability to output contents of several files with one command, however, to submit the s21_cat project, it is enough to be able to process one file. There is a small difference in output, which is better to take into account at start, so as not to create crutches later.
